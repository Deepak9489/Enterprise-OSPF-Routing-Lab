# Enterprise OSPF Routing Lab

Enterprise-level Cisco Packet Tracer lab demonstrating dynamic routing using OSPF Area 0, neighbor adjacency, route advertisement, routing-table verification, end-to-end connectivity, and network troubleshooting.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an enterprise network connecting:

- 🏢 HQ
- 🏢 Branch Office
- 🗄️ Data Center

OSPF is used as the dynamic routing protocol to provide automatic route learning and connectivity between the different network segments.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Configure OSPF on Cisco routers
- Configure OSPF Area 0
- Configure unique OSPF Router IDs
- Establish OSPF neighbor adjacency
- Advertise LAN and point-to-point networks
- Verify OSPF learned routes
- Test end-to-end connectivity
- Troubleshoot OSPF adjacency and connectivity issues
- Document the enterprise routing solution
